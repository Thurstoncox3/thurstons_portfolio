## Usage
- The user should be able to "click" on the Email, and be able to contact me.
- The user should be able to "click" on the LinkedIn, and be able to contact me.
- The user should be able to "click" on the Phone, and be able to contact me (although the "click" for phone, shouldnt take you anywhere).
