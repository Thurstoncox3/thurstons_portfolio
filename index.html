                <p>
                    Built with a team, we have created an app where the user will be able to battle the selected Pokemon based off the current location of the user. The
                    Pokemon powers and attacks will be influenced by the weather that is occuring in the users current
                    area.
                    The battle continues without the users input, however the user will be able to see the health status
                    of both Pokemon to stay interactive with the battle.

                    <p> Over the little time that I have atteneded the UNCC Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp, I have created several Repositories. These repositories vary from HTML/CSS style, to more indepth frontend and backend JavaScript.
