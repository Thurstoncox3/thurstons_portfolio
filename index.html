                <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
                <p>
                    I am an eager, optimistic, 28 year old father. I have traveled to about 12 or 13 different states.
                    I've be to music festivals from EDC Las Vegas to the Hangout Festival in Gulf Shore. I play the
                    Ukalele (not well), and skateboard in my free time. The reason I am looking for something new in my
                    career is to mainly be able to provide for my family, with security and stability for our future.

                <h2>Why?</h2>
                <p>
                    I start my journey in web developement completely blind. My focus is to be apart of a team that can
                    focus on a mission statement I can believe in. I would like to be apart of a company that is
                    steadily growing, and would push career goals in the right direction.

                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    I am from Raleigh, NC, I have currently lived in Charlotte for about 8 years. I fell in love with
                    the city and people. I attended East Carolina University for 2 years, I was also "on" the football
                    team there. Once I left ECU, I transferred to Uncc, where I studied Sociology and Philosophy. After
                    working in sales for about 4 year, I am now looking to broaden my knowledge by applying the UNCC
                    Full Stack Bootcamp to my future career.
