                <p> Horiseon needs for the Search Engine Optimization to be increased, to the point where the webpage
                    opens in a formatible way. The HTML needs image and attributes, while the StyleSheet, needed updated
                    pages, colors, fonts, and backgrounds in the appropriate places.

                <p>
                    Built with a team, we have created an app where the user will be able to battle the selected Pokemon based off the current location of the user. The
                    Pokemon powers and attacks will be influenced by the weather that is occuring in the users current
                    area.
                    The battle continues without the users input, however the user will be able to see the health status
                    of both Pokemon to stay interactive with the battle.

                    <p> Over the little time that I have atteneded the UNCC Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp, I have created several Repositories. These repositories vary from simple HTML/CSS style, to more indepth JavaScript. This link above will allow to view some active projects I have created, whether alone, or with a team, and it will allow for you to see what I am currently working on.
